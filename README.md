# Drag-and-Drop-TTT
Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe

The objective of Drag and Drop Tic Tac Toe remains the same as the traditional version. Players
aim to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their objects (X or O) on the game board,
indicating a winning move.
Game Setup:
The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid, just like traditional Tic Tac Toe.
Each player has three distinct objects to use, for example, three X's or three O's.
Gameplay:
The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
Players take turns, beginning with one player (let's call them Player X) and alternating between
players. Once a player has placed all three of their objects on the board, they can continue to
move their objects around the board by dragging and dropping them on their subsequent turns.
During their turn, a player can drag one of their objects (X or O) and drop it onto an empty cell
on the game board.
The game continues until one player successfully creates a line of three of their objects
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This player wins the game.
Winning:
The game is won when a player forms a line of three of their objects (X's or O's) in a row,
column, or diagonal.
Additional Rules of game:
Players must use all three of their objects before they can start moving their objects around the
board.
A Player Cannot move other player’s Object
Players must drag and drop their objects onto empty cells.
Players cannot stack objects on top of each other in a single cell. Each cell can hold only one
object.
Players cannot move his/her object if his/her object is surrounded by other player’s object.
